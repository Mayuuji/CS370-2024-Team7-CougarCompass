In todayâ€™s Scrum meeting, the team reviewed the progress from the previous sprint, addressing any remaining blockers related 
to the design and coding of the parent and child classes. The goals for this sprint were clarified, focusing on establishing

classes. The lead developer presented the object-oriented design, prompting a discussion on the logic of the class structure,
