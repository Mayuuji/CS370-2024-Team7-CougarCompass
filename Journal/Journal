Scrum meeting 2 10/14/2024
Identifying and Mitigating Potential Roadblocks in the Current Sprint
This topic encourages team members to proactively discuss any challenges they are facing or anticipate that might prevent them 
from achieving their sprint goals. It focuses on identifying impediments early, sharing ideas for resolving them, and ensuring 
everyone is aligned to keep the sprint on track.

Scrum meeting 3 10/21/2024
In today’s Scrum meeting, the team reviewed the progress from the previous sprint, addressing any remaining blockers related 
to the design and coding of the parent and child classes. The goals for this sprint were clarified, focusing on establishing 
the class hierarchy, defining shared methods and attributes for the parent class, and ensuring proper inheritance in the child 
classes. The lead developer presented the object-oriented design, prompting a discussion on the logic of the class structure, 
potential redundancies, and future extensibility. The team then outlined the coding plan, assigning tasks for both the parent 
and child classes, and discussed the integration of test cases. Potential challenges were raised, with the Scrum Master noting 
action steps to resolve them. The meeting concluded with a confirmation of tasks and commitments for the sprint, ensuring 
everyone is aligned for the next steps.

Scrum meeting 4 10/28/2024
In today’s scrum meeting, the team reviewed the requirements and planned the finalization process for the UML sequence diagrams.
After sharing updates and addressing any blockers, the facilitator reminded everyone of the submission criteria: each 
diagram must include more than just "User" and "System," involving key system objects to ensure clarity. If the project has 
less than four use cases, object-object interaction diagrams will be incorporated to enhance design focus, while, for projects
with more than four use cases, the team decided to prioritize the four most crucial ones. Emphasis was placed on clarity, 
readability, and consistency in diagram elements, including font sizes, colors, and line weights, to guarantee legibility. 
Each team member provided feedback on the diagrams, ensuring alignment with use cases and validating interactions. After 
finalization, the diagrams will be prepared in the designated submission format, and a final quality check will be conducted 
through a peer review. To wrap up, the team outlined follow-up tasks, including system design documentation, and assigned any 
action items for the next sprint based on feedback from this session.

Scrum meeting 5 11/4/2024
In today’s scrum meeting, the team discussed the approach for developing a comprehensive system structural design (level-3) 
for the course project. The meeting began with a review of the primary objectives: creating a well-organized, modular system 
model by grouping related concepts and classes into packages or subsystems. The team will identify the key system objects—such 
as DBAdapter, GameEngine, xManager, Communicator, Coordinator, msgSender, and msgReceiver—ensuring these active objects cover 
all major functionalities identified during the previous sequence diagram work. Special attention will be paid to defining 
object and component interfaces, with each class including public operations and implementing abstract superclasses or 
interfaces where possible. The team also discussed the façade pattern and its potential use to simplify complex subsystems,
ensuring the design remains clear and maintainable.
